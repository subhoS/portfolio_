// Fix Summary for Blog Prerendering Error

The issue was in the Next.js 15+ dynamic route handling. In Next.js 15+, 
the params prop is now a Promise that needs to be awaited.

CHANGES MADE:

1. **Updated app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx**
   - Changed `params: { slug: string }` to `params: Promise<{ slug: string }>`
   - Added `const { slug } = await params;` to await the promise
   - Added proper null check for slug
   - Wrapped post loading in try-catch with error handling
   - Added error fallback UI

2. **Enhanced lib/posts.ts**
   - Added console logging to track which posts are found
   - Better error logging in getPostSlugs()

3. **Added error handling**
   - Graceful fallback if post can't be loaded
   - Better error messages for debugging

This ensures that:
✅ generateStaticParams() correctly discovers blog posts
✅ Dynamic params are properly handled in Next.js 15+
✅ Build won't fail if a post is missing
✅ Users get a friendly error message if something goes wrong

The blog should now build successfully!
