faq:
  - q: "Why is search harder than it looks?"
    a: "Good search combines fast input handling on the frontend, relevance ranking, typo tolerance, filtering and fresh data on the backend. Each part is simple alone; making them fast and accurate together at scale is the challenge."
  - q: "When should I use Elasticsearch instead of database search?"
    a: "Use Elasticsearch or OpenSearch when you need relevance ranking, fuzzy matching, faceted filtering or fast full-text search over large datasets. For small datasets or simple filters, PostgreSQL full-text search may be enough."
  - q: "What is change data capture (CDC)?"
    a: "CDC streams every insert, update and delete from a database's transaction log to other systems, for example through Debezium and Kafka. It keeps search indexes and caches in sync with the database without dual writes in application code."
  - q: "How does debouncing help search performance?"
    a: "Debouncing waits until the user pauses typing before sending a search request, which typically cuts requests from one per keystroke to one or two per search and reduces load on the search backend."

## Introduction: Why Search Is Harder Than It Looks

Type a few letters into Google or Amazon, and results appear instantly, ranked, relevant, and fresh.

Behind that magic lies a chain of complex engineering ideas:

- **Debouncing** makes typing feel smooth
- **Ranking algorithms** decide what appears first
- **Elasticsearch** retrieves relevant results at scale
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)** keeps everything up-to-date in real time

Let's break down each piece, work through some examples, and then tie them all together.

---

## 1. Debouncing: The First Layer of Performance

When a user types in a search box, every keystroke can trigger an API call, wasting bandwidth and straining your backend.

Example: typing "apple" fires 5 requests:

```
a → ap → app → appl → apple
```

That's inefficient. **Debouncing** fixes this by waiting until the user stops typing before firing off a request.

### How Debouncing Works

Wait X milliseconds after the last keystroke before executing the function. If another keystroke happens before the delay ends, reset the timer.

### Example (JavaScript)

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeout;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

// Usage
const handleSearch = debounce((query) => {
  fetch(`/api/search?q=${query}`)
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((data) => console.log(data));
}, 300);
```

**Result:** Only one API call after the user stops typing. Smoother UX, less backend load.

### Performance Impact

Without debouncing:

- 1000 users typing 5 characters = 5,000 requests
- With debouncing: same scenario = 1,000 requests

That's an **80% reduction** in unnecessary API calls!

## 2. Ranking: Making Search Results Relevant

Once the query hits your backend, you need to determine which results should rank first.

Ranking is the "brain" of search. It determines what's most relevant.

### Common Ranking Factors

1. **Text relevance**: how well the content matches the query
2. **Popularity**: e.g., click counts, purchases
3. **Recency**: newer results may rank higher
4. **Personalization**: user preferences or history
5. **User signals**: likes, shares, time-spent

### Simplified Ranking Formula

```
Final Score = (text_score × 0.6) + (popularity × 0.3) + (recency × 0.1)
```

This formula is weighted because:

- **60%** text relevance (user is looking for specific content)
- **30%** popularity (trusted/purchased products rank higher)
- **10%** recency (fresh products get a small boost)

---

### Example Ranking Scenario

Imagine searching for "wireless headphones". Here's how three products score:

![Ranking Comparison](/ranking-comparison.svg)

_Visual breakdown showing why Sony ranks #1: balanced excellence across all ranking factors._

**Sony WH-1000XM5**

- Text Score: 95/100 (matches "wireless" + "headphones")
- Popularity: 90/100 (50K+ purchases)
- Recency: 85/100 (released 2 years ago, still current)
- **Final Score: 90.8** ⭐ **#1 Ranked**

**Generic Headphones**

- Text Score: 85/100 (matches query but less specific)
- Popularity: 40/100 (5K purchases)
- Recency: 95/100 (just released)
- **Final Score: 73.5** (not enough popularity)

**Vintage Headphones**

- Text Score: 88/100 (matches but labeled "vintage")
- Popularity: 30/100 (old product, few recent purchases)
- Recency: 20/100 (released 10 years ago)
- **Final Score: 60.4** (low overall score)

**Result:** Sony ranks first because it excels across all factors. Users see the most relevant product first!

### Real-World Algorithms

Search engines use sophisticated algorithms:

- **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency): classic approach
- **BM25**: a modern improvement on TF-IDF (used by Elasticsearch)
- **Learning to Rank (LTR)**: machine learning-based ranking

**BM25 Formula (Simplified):**

```
score(D, Q) = Σ IDF(qi) × (f(qi, D) × (k1 + 1)) / (f(qi, D) + k1 × (1 - b + b × |D| / avgdl))
```

Where:

- `D` = document
- `Q` = query
- `IDF` = inverse document frequency
- `f` = term frequency
- `k1`, `b` = tuning parameters

## 3. Elasticsearch: The Engine Powering Modern Search

**Elasticsearch** is a distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene. Companies like Netflix, Uber, and Shopify use it to power their search systems.

### Why Elasticsearch?

- **Blazing fast full-text search** – searches millions of documents in milliseconds
- **Scalable** – handles billions of documents across clusters
- **Powerful ranking and scoring** built-in (BM25)
- **Supports** fuzzy search, filtering, and aggregations
- **RESTful API** – integrates with any backend

### Basic Architecture

| Component    | Description                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Index**    | A collection of documents (like a database table)  |
| **Document** | A single data record (like a JSON object)          |
| **Shard**    | A portion of an index distributed across nodes     |
| **Replica**  | A copy of a shard for redundancy                   |
| **Query**    | The search request from the user                   |
| **Score**    | A numeric value showing how relevant the result is |

### Example: Index and Document

```json
PUT /products/_doc/1
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
  "description": "Premium sound quality with noise cancellation",
  "price": 299.99,
  "rating": 4.8,
  "reviews_count": 1250
}
```

### Example: Simple Query

```json
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "wireless headphones"
    }
  },
  "size": 10,
  "from": 0
}
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "hits": {
    "total": { "value": 42 },
    "hits": [
      {
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 8.95,
        "_source": {
          "title": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
          "price": 299.99,
          "rating": 4.8
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Advanced: Combining Multiple Queries

```json
GET /products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        { "match": { "title": "headphones" } }
      ],
      "filter": [
        { "range": { "price": { "lte": 500 } } },
        { "term": { "in_stock": true } }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This query returns products matching "headphones" that are under $500 and in stock.

## 4. Change Data Capture (CDC): Keeping Search Fresh

Even the best search index becomes outdated if your source data changes.

When products are added, deleted, or updated in your main database, your search index must stay in sync. That's where Change Data Capture (CDC) comes in.

### What Is CDC?

CDC continuously monitors your database for changes and streams them to another system, like Elasticsearch.

### The Problem CDC Solves

Imagine an e-commerce platform:

- Product gets updated in MySQL
- Price drops to $99
- But search still shows $199
- Customer buys, expecting $99 price
- **Revenue loss. Angry customer. Bad review.**

CDC prevents this by ensuring search is always up-to-date.

### Example Flow

1. **User updates product price** in MySQL (from $299 → $199)
2. **CDC tool (Debezium)** captures the change in MySQL binlog
3. **Message sent to Kafka** with the update event
4. **Kafka Consumer** reads the event
5. **Elasticsearch updated** with new price
6. **Next search query** returns updated price ✅

### CDC Architecture Diagram

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   MySQL Database    │
│   Product updated   │
│   (price: $199)     │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │ (binlog)
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Debezium (CDC)     │
│  Captures changes   │
└──────────┬──────────┘

           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Elasticsearch      │
│  (Index updated)    │
└─────────────────────┘
```

# Flask: Update product → trigger search update
from flask import Flask
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/products/<id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_product(id):
    # Update database
    product = db.products.update(id, request.json)

    # Trigger search index update
    requests.post('http://localhost:9200/products/_doc/' + id,
                  json=product)

    return product
```

### Request Flow Example

**User searches: "wireless headphones under $300"**

1. **Frontend (Debounce)**: User types "wireless headphones", waits 300ms after last keystroke
2. **API Call**: `/api/search?q=wireless%20headphones&maxPrice=300&limit=10`
3. **Backend Processing**:
   - Validate & sanitize query
   - Check Redis cache for identical query (if configured)
   - Build search query for chosen engine
4. **Search Engine Query** (e.g., Elasticsearch):
   ```
   match("wireless headphones") AND price <= 300
   ```
   - Engine returns 42 results, ranked by BM25 score + custom factors
5. **Backend Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "results": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "title": "Sony WH-1000XM5",
         "price": 299.99,
         "score": 8.95,
         "highlights": "<strong>Wireless</strong> <strong>Headphones</strong>"
       },
       {
         "id": 2,
         "title": "Bose QC45 Headphones",
         "price": 279.99,
         "score": 8.42,
         "highlights": "<strong>Wireless</strong> Premium <strong>Headphones</strong>"
       }
     ],
     "total": 42,
     "facets": {
       "brands": [
         { "name": "Sony", "count": 15 },
         { "name": "Bose", "count": 12 }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```
6. **Frontend Display**: Renders results with highlighting, user sees relevant products instantly 🎉
7. **Real-Time Sync**: If a product price drops, CDC captures it and updates the index within seconds

## 6. Step-by-Step Easy Implementation

Let's tie it all together with a working example setup 👇

### Frontend: Debounced Search Input (React)

```javascript
import { useState, useCallback } from "react";

function SearchComponent() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  // Debounce function
  const debounce = (func, delay) => {
    let timeout;
    return (...args) => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      timeout = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
    };
  };

  // Search handler
  const handleSearch = useCallback(
    debounce(async (searchQuery) => {
      if (!searchQuery.trim()) {
        setResults([]);
        return;
      }

      setLoading(true);
      try {
        const response = await fetch(
          `/api/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(searchQuery)}`
        );
        const data = await response.json();
        setResults(data.results);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Search error:", error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }, 300),
    []
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Search products..."
        value={query}
        onChange={(e) => {
          setQuery(e.target.value);
          handleSearch(e.target.value);
        }}
      />
      {loading && <p>Searching...</p>}
      <ul>
        {results.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            {item.title} - ${item.price}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default SearchComponent;
```

---

### Backend: Node.js + Elasticsearch API

```javascript
import express from "express";
import { Client } from "@elastic/elasticsearch";

const client = new Client({ node: "http://localhost:9200" });
const app = express();

app.get("/api/search", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const query = req.query.q || "";
    const maxPrice = req.query.maxPrice ? parseFloat(req.query.maxPrice) : null;

    if (!query.trim()) {
      return res.json({ results: [] });
    }

    // Build Elasticsearch query
    const esQuery = {
      index: "products",
      body: {
        query: {
          bool: {
            must: [
              {
                multi_match: {
                  query: query,
                  fields: ["title^2", "description", "tags"],
                  fuzziness: "AUTO",
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        },
        size: 20,
        sort: [{ _score: "desc" }],
      },
    };

    // Add price filter if provided
    if (maxPrice) {
      esQuery.body.query.bool.filter = [
        { range: { price: { lte: maxPrice } } },
      ];
    }

    const result = await client.search(esQuery);

    // Transform results
    const results = result.hits.hits.map((hit) => ({
      id: hit._id,
      score: hit._score,
      ...hit._source,
    }));

    res.json({
      results,
      total: result.hits.total.value,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Search error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Search failed" });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Search API running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

### Setting Up Elasticsearch Locally (Docker)

```bash
# Start Elasticsearch with Docker
docker run -d \
  -p 9200:9200 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.0.0

# Create products index with mapping
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/products" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": { "type": "text" },
      "description": { "type": "text" },
      "price": { "type": "float" },
      "rating": { "type": "float" },
      "in_stock": { "type": "boolean" }
    }
  }
}'

# Index sample data
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/products/_doc/1" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "title": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
  "description": "Premium sound quality with noise cancellation",
  "price": 299.99,
  "rating": 4.8,
  "in_stock": true
}'
```

---

### Database Sync: CDC with Debezium

**Step 1: Start Kafka & Zookeeper**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Step 2: Create Debezium MySQL Connector**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/connectors \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "mysql-cdc-connector",
    "config": {
      "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
      "database.hostname": "mysql",
      "database.port": 3306,
      "database.user": "root",
      "database.password": "password",
      "database.server.id": 1,
      "database.server.name": "mysql-server",
      "database.include.list": "ecommerce",
      "table.include.list": "ecommerce.products",
      "plugin.name": "pgoutput"
    }
  }'
```

**Step 3: Create Elasticsearch Sink Connector**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/connectors \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "es-sink-connector",
    "config": {
      "connector.class": "com.github.dariobalinzo.kafka.connect.ElasticsearchSinkConnector",
      "topics": "mysql-server.ecommerce.products",
      "connection.url": "http://elasticsearch:9200",
      "connection.user": "elastic",
      "connection.password": "password",
      "type.name": "_doc",
      "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter",
      "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"
    }
  }'
```

**Step 4: Test the Flow**

```bash
# Update a product in MySQL
UPDATE products SET price = 199.99 WHERE id = 1;

# Check Elasticsearch (should be updated)
curl "http://localhost:9200/products/_doc/1"
```

✅ **Result:** Price updated in MySQL → CDC captures it → Kafka streams it → Elasticsearch updates it!

## 7. Performance Tips & Optimization

### Frontend Optimization

```javascript
// 1. Adjust debounce delay based on API latency
const DEBOUNCE_DELAY = 300; // ms

// 2. Add loading state to prevent duplicate requests
const [isSearching, setIsSearching] = useState(false);

// 3. Cache results for repeated queries
const resultsCache = new Map();
```

### Elasticsearch Optimization

```javascript
// 1. Use keyword fields for exact matching
"product_id": { "type": "keyword" }

// 2. Add analyzers for better text search
"title": {
  "type": "text",
  "analyzer": "standard",
  "fields": {
    "keyword": { "type": "keyword" }
  }
}

// 3. Enable sharding for scale
"settings": {
  "number_of_shards": 5,
  "number_of_replicas": 2
}
```

### Backend Optimization

```javascript
// 1. Add query result caching
const Redis = require("redis");
const redis = Redis.createClient();

// 2. Implement pagination
const size = 20;
const from = (page - 1) * size;

// 3. Monitor query performance
console.time("elasticsearch_query");
const result = await client.search(query);
console.timeEnd("elasticsearch_query");
```
